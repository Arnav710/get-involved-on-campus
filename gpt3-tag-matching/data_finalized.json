It was discovered by a Japanese doctor, Ryuta Kawashima, and consists of math exercises and reading aloud of short stories. Done for just 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week, improvements in Alzheimer\u2019s patients have been observed. It is currently being done in 1,400 care homes with 15,000 Alzheimer's patients all over Japan and has had great success. Many individuals showed improvements in communication and behavior. Some went from being bedridden to sitting in a chair or walking. Some showed improvement in controlling their bowel movement. Additionally, they began to feel happier.",

        "description": "1. Fellowship: Since Christian students have a common purpose, it follows that they should meet together for encouragement, edification, uplifting, and sharing. The scientific training involved in pharmacy education may stem from a humanist/agnostic philosophy. Therefore, regular meetings of Christians can help students maintain perspective on the \u201cbig picture\u201d God has planned for mankind as He revealed in the Bible. 2. Bible Study/Discussion/Prayer: The need to examine, study, and struggle with social/medical issues has never been greater. Faith rooted in Scripture builds firm convictions about God, man, lifestyle, human relationships, the purpose of science, and the nature of a profession. Christian principles taught through the Bible equip pharmacy students to become compassionate pharmacists that go above and beyond to care for the entire patient by meeting their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Times of discussion encourage growth of the chapter through shared experiences and individual insights. Prayer helps the chapter to remain dependent on God. 3. Ministry Projects: A young attorney once asked Jesus a test question in an attempt to entrap him. \u201cWhat shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d Jesus responded with a question of his own. \u201cYou know the Law. How do you read it? Sum it up in one sentence.\u201d The young attorney quickly answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.\u201d (Luke 10:25-29 and Mark 10:17) Jesus complimented the attorney on his succinct answer and told him to do just as he had answered. One of the characteristics of our society today is the rapid decline of a sense of community in tandem with an epidemic of autonomy. One does not have to travel far to do mission work; many opportunities are available in every community. Wherever God has placed you is your mission field and even closer to \u201chome\u201d are those who sit next to you in class every day. Remember that we are told to start at home (Jerusalem), then work with interfacing cultures (Judea and Samaria), and then distant cultures (ends of the earth). 4. Witness: \u201cBut you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\u201d Acts 1:8 Every one of us is a witness for Jesus Christ. The question is, \u201cAre we effective?\u201d Student chapters should consider evangelism as individuals and as a chapter. The chapter should be a source of strength and encouragement for personal outreach. There is another facet to our Christian witness: The individual who sees himself/herself called by God and who knows Jesus Christ as the Lord of all creation is vitally concerned about this world and its values and priorities. Our witness involves not only a verbal declaration of the saving power of Jesus Christ, but a promotion of Christian alternatives to secularism and other \u201cisms\u201d which are dehumanizing and degrading to man. The Christian view of life has more than a passing relevance to a discipline concerned with life, death, and the person. A chapter genuinely concerned with its witness must seek to let its light radiate forth in the midst of the healthcare community, piercing every facet. 5. Worship: \u201cShout for joy to the LORD, all the earth. Worship the LORD with gladness; come before him with joyful songs. Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture. Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name. For the LORD is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.\u201d Psalm 100 Though worship may not be the primary goal of our student chapter, it will be difficult to meet regularly as Christians and not spend some time worshiping our Heavenly Father. Worship will often unify a student chapter as no other activity can, and it is greatly encouraged where ever Christians gather.",

Falun Dafa is not a religion, there is no membership and is completely free of charge! It is a mind-body practice with a spiritual component that covers metaphysics, ethics and enlightenment. Through persistent practice one strives to achieve a state of selflessness, increased insight, inner purity, balance- true health and ultimately enlightenment. Since July 1999 the communist government of China has persecuted and enslaved millions of innocent people for practicing Falun Dafa and they comprise 65% of labor camps, detention centers and prisons across China for believing in Truth- Compassion- Forbearance. Evidence from acclaimed sources have proven tens of thousands of Falun Dafa practitioners to have been killed from live organ harvesting for China\u2019s lucrative organ transplant market. So what do we, as an organization, do on campus? We meditate together and teach the exercises, promote cultural art events that revive traditional Chinese culture and raise awareness about the persecution and organ harvesting of Falun Dafa practitioners in China.",

Our primary goals is to qualify for Intercollegiate Nationals hosted at the end of each season. Each skater performs individually in events of their choosing (in their corresponding level). The points they earn from podium placement get added to the UCSD cumulative team score which goes towards rankings. The top four teams per section are invited to Nationals at the end of the season, and we have qualified the last 3 years in a row! Intercollegiate competitions are a great place to have fun and bond as a team as well as getting to network with like-minded skaters and students from all over the nation. \r\n\r\nCompeting, while fun, is not a requirement. Our team is also open to anyone who loves figure skating! We host different social events throughout the year for skating enthusiasts and skaters alike - watch parties, skating night, and of course dessert trips. With many of our members being long time skaters and some even being professional coaches, it's a great networking opportunity for people who have never skated before but would love to give it a try! \r\n\r\nOur team is tight knit on and off the ice. Practices are largely self scheduled as figure skating is a sport driven by individual motivation to improve. However, members often carpool to practice help one another with jumps, spins, and choreography. Figure Skating at UCSD is open to anyone who loves the ice, and whether you've been competing your whole life or you've never put on a pair of skates before, this team has a place for you.",

Tijuana is facing several public health crises,  including an HIV epidemic, elevated rates of drug addiction (compared to  the national average), issues associated with a large homeless  population, and an influx of Haitian refugees. These crises have been  driven in part by US deportation and immigration policies, lack of local  resources, police brutality, and a refusal to deal with these issues by the  city government. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Fronteras Saludables (Healthier Borders) will support the efforts of the  HFiT free clinic through fundraising for medical supplies,  \r\nmedications, and other equipment. Health Frontiers in Tijuana (HFiT) is  a student-run free clinic established in Tijuana, Mexico. HFiT was  founded as a partnership between UCSD's School of Medicine and  Tijuana\u2019s Autonomous University of Baja California School of Medicine  (UABC), the only publicly funded medical school in Tijuana, in 2011. Since  then, HFiT continues to serve vulnerable populations, including substance  users, sex workers, the homeless, deportees, and indigent patients. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Fronteras Saludables (Healthier Borders) will inform UCSD  undergraduates about opportunities to get involved through the HFIT  internship program and other supporting roles. Current HFIT interns  who want to be part of the student organization will share their  experiences with new members. Motivated students who want to join the internship program (HFiT-UIP) and/or want to provide assistance outside  of the clinic will be given information on how to apply and how to take leadership roles in fundraising and public health efforts.",

We host technical and professional workshops, social events, and K-12 outreach events. In addition to these, we host a variety of large, annual events such as HARD HACK, our 24 hour hardware hackathon, and ECE Reverse Career Fair, to name a few.\r\n\r\nMost companies look more for projects than they do for grades. To that end, we offer multiple projects students can participate in to hone their technical skills and stand out to employers. Our projects are split into three categories: quarterly, annual, and continuous. Quarterly projects are beginner oriented and no experience is necessary to join them. Throughout the quarter there are project oriented technical workshops and mentors to help you in bring your idea to life. At the end of each quarter, teams compete in the showcase for the top spot. Our annual projects require more experience to join and compete against other schools at the end of each year. Some examples are Grand PrIEEE, our line following robot, and Project Drive, our autonomous car. Our continuous project is Robocup Soccer, a soccer playing robot that competes against other universities. This project is almost always hiring and and requires no prior experience to join.",

Students who do not meet these minimum requirements (including new transfer students) are welcome to join the chapter by being Psychology Club members. At meetings both Psi Chi and Psychology Club members work together using Robert\u2019s Rules of Order to vote on the direction of the chapter for the academic year.

This group promotes Garba and Raas, two interrelated West-Indian dance forms that originated from the state of Gujarat. In this day and age, Garba & Raas have been transformed from the deeply traditional precursors to the more energetic, contemporary form that is practiced by this team. In addition to simply developing and performing modern Garba/Raas choreography on campus, this team intends to partake in national, collegiate Garba/Raas competitions, thereby representing the University of California, San Diego and promoting school pride. At the local level, this seems also seeks to promote cultural and social awareness of this dance form and the related cultural connotation by performing on campus, and at nearby universities, as well as by eliciting participation from the student body. An implicit goal of this organization is to build a community at UC San Diego for all students who dance for the team and wish to be involved.",
